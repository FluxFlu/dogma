                List of steps the compiler goes through to compile a program:
            </p>


<h>Directives are interpreted</h>

<p>
Directives are lines of code starting with a pound <cb>#</cb>.

Interpreting these is the first step in compilation, which is the reason the following code still runs properly:

</p>
<pre>

console.log(x);
#define [x] [200]

</pre>
<br><br><br><br>
<h>Values are cooked</h>
<p>
Cooking is the term for evaluating code at compile time rather than runtime using angle braces <cb>&lt;&gt;</cb>.

An example of this is as follows:

</p>
<pre>

#define [x] [200]
console.log(&lt;x + 20&gt;);

</pre>
<br><br><br><br>
<h>Token groups are grouped</h>
<p>
Token groups are groups of tokens that are to be treated as a single token for the purposes of macro substitution. This is done using a dollar and then braces <cb>$()</cb>.

These being interpreted after cooking is the reason the following code still runs properly:

</p>
<pre>

#define [x] [200]
console.log($(&lt;x + 4&gt; + &lt;x + 20&gt;));

</pre>
<br><br><br><br>
<h>Macros are handled</h>
<p>
Macro substitution is when values are substituted for other values at compile time. This is done using the <cb>#define</cb> directive.

These being interpreted after token groups is the reason the following code still runs properly:

</p>
<pre>

#define [add($x, $y)] [$x + $y]
console.log(add( $(1 + 2), 3 ));

</pre>
<br><br><br><br>
<h>Values are cooked a second time</h>
<p>
The final code is then cooked again.

This is the reason the following code works:
</p>
<pre>

#define [add($x, $y)] [&lt;$x + $y&gt;]
console.log(add( $(1 + 2), 3 ));

</pre>
